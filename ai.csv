Job Summary


This job is about producing open-source machine learning software in support of DARPA-funded research on ""data driven discovery of models"" (D3M - https://www.darpa.mil/program/data-driven-discovery-of-models) and ""Learning with less labels"" (LWLL - https://www.darpa.mil/program/learning-with-less-labels). The basic idea is to transition research from Dr. Wood's ""programming languages and artificial intelligence"" (PLAI) group at UBC (https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood) into production-quality software that can be shared with other DARPA program performers and the world.

Our collective aim is to leverage techniques from deep learning, reinforcement learning, and probabilistic programming to a) fully automate machine learning (training dataset -> fully trained model) and to do so with orders of magnitude fewer labels (semi- and un-supervised learning).
The basic job will be to code, to high professional open-source standards, impactful algorithmic and modeling outputs from the PLAI group. Also, importantly, to respond to team and program requests for software outputs and solutions to challenge problems imposed by DARPA, etc.

This position is different to most industry machine learning developer positions in that the job holder will be implementing state of the art algorithms and working directly with and in support of the researchers developing these algorithms. For this reason, the job can be reasonably expected to be extremely challenging in terms of how fast the job holder will have to be able to take up and understand new techniques and technology. The positive consequence of this is that the job will not be boring.



Organizational Status


Reports to the faculty member responsible for the research grant and software development effort. Incumbent will also interact with other faculty, postdoctoral research fellows and students in the laboratory.



Work Performed


Design, develop, and implement custom machine learning systems based on current research
Translate laboratory research into open-source software
Respond, in code and produced outputs, to DARPA-specified challenge problems
Collaborate with research team, sponsor, and external team members
Participate in coordination calls with DARPA and external team members
Manage technical relationships with some DARPA and external team members
Document and maintain open-source software repositories



Supervision Received


Formally reports to Dr. Wood; daily supervision will be provided by the laboratory manager, postdoctoral researchers, and senior research PhD students in the group.



Supervision Given


On a case by case basis, student programmers (interns and the like) may be hired to assist the overall effort and direct management of their software practice and output may be expected. As well, junior PhD and MS students' software outputs may be managed throughout.



Consequence of Error/Judgement


Third and fourth year funding on both efforts is contingent on satisfactory performance on DARPA-specified challenge problems. Failure to perform could mean discontinued funding.



Qualifications


Undergraduate degree in Engineering or Applied Science. Machine learning foundation: Required: UBC CS340 (https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/CS340/) or equivalent. Includes: automatic differentiation, regression, classification, SVM's, logistic regression, random forests, conceptual understanding of test/training/validation and understanding of overfitting on the validation set in particular.
Desired: UBC CS540 (https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Courses/540-W18/) or equivalent. Includes: reinforcement learning, Monte-Carlo tree search, stochastic variational inference, graphical models.
Desired: probabilistic programming (https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/CS532W-539W/) A minimum of 5 years of experience or the equivalent combination of education and experience. A reasonable candidate is a professional Python developer with a strong CS or statistics educational background, a high level of familiarity with the Python and PyTorch ecosystems, and an urge to do something more challenging, perhaps en route to a graduate degree or a ML-related startup.
Programming and related CS skills:required: Python, PyTorch, git, compiler and parser programming desired: SLURM, cloud-compute, shell-scripting, databases.

Job Summary


This job is about producing open-source machine learning software in support of DARPA-funded research on ""data driven discovery of models"" (D3M - https://www.darpa.mil/program/data-driven-discovery-of-models) and ""Learning with less labels"" (LWLL - https://www.darpa.mil/program/learning-with-less-labels). The basic idea is to transition research from Dr. Wood's ""programming languages and artificial intelligence"" (PLAI) group at UBC (https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood) into production-quality software that can be shared with other DARPA program performers and the world.

Our collective aim is to leverage techniques from deep learning, reinforcement learning, and probabilistic programming to a) fully automate machine learning (training dataset -> fully trained model) and to do so with orders of magnitude fewer labels (semi- and un-supervised learning).
The basic job will be to code, to high professional open-source standards, impactful algorithmic and modeling outputs from the PLAI group. Also, importantly, to respond to team and program requests for software outputs and solutions to challenge problems imposed by DARPA, etc.

This position is different to most industry machine learning developer positions in that the job holder will be implementing state of the art algorithms and working directly with and in support of the researchers developing these algorithms. For this reason, the job can be reasonably expected to be extremely challenging in terms of how fast the job holder will have to be able to take up and understand new techniques and technology. The positive consequence of this is that the job will not be boring.



Organizational Status


Reports to the faculty member responsible for the research grant and software development effort. Incumbent will also interact with other faculty, postdoctoral research fellows and students in the laboratory.



Work Performed


Design, develop, and implement custom machine learning systems based on current research
Translate laboratory research into open-source software
Respond, in code and produced outputs, to DARPA-specified challenge problems
Collaborate with research team, sponsor, and external team members
Participate in coordination calls with DARPA and external team members
Manage technical relationships with some DARPA and external team members
Document and maintain open-source software repositories



Supervision Received


Formally reports to Dr. Wood; daily supervision will be provided by the laboratory manager, postdoctoral researchers, and senior research PhD students in the group.



Supervision Given


On a case by case basis, student programmers (interns and the like) may be hired to assist the overall effort and direct management of their software practice and output may be expected. As well, junior PhD and MS students' software outputs may be managed throughout.



Consequence of Error/Judgement


Third and fourth year funding on both efforts is contingent on satisfactory performance on DARPA-specified challenge problems. Failure to perform could mean discontinued funding.



Qualifications


Undergraduate degree in Engineering or Applied Science. Machine learning foundation: Required: UBC CS340 (https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/CS340/) or equivalent. Includes: automatic differentiation, regression, classification, SVM's, logistic regression, random forests, conceptual understanding of test/training/validation and understanding of overfitting on the validation set in particular.
Desired: UBC CS540 (https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Courses/540-W18/) or equivalent. Includes: reinforcement learning, Monte-Carlo tree search, stochastic variational inference, graphical models.
Desired: probabilistic programming (https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/CS532W-539W/) A minimum of 5 years of experience or the equivalent combination of education and experience. A reasonable candidate is a professional Python developer with a strong CS or statistics educational background, a high level of familiarity with the Python and PyTorch ecosystems, and an urge to do something more challenging, perhaps en route to a graduate degree or a ML-related startup.
Programming and related CS skills:required: Python, PyTorch, git, compiler and parser programming desired: SLURM, cloud-compute, shell-scripting, databases.

Job Summary


This job is about producing open-source machine learning software in support of DARPA-funded research on ""data driven discovery of models"" (D3M - https://www.darpa.mil/program/data-driven-discovery-of-models) and ""Learning with less labels"" (LWLL - https://www.darpa.mil/program/learning-with-less-labels). The basic idea is to transition research from Dr. Wood's ""programming languages and artificial intelligence"" (PLAI) group at UBC (https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood) into production-quality software that can be shared with other DARPA program performers and the world.

Our collective aim is to leverage techniques from deep learning, reinforcement learning, and probabilistic programming to a) fully automate machine learning (training dataset -> fully trained model) and to do so with orders of magnitude fewer labels (semi- and un-supervised learning).
The basic job will be to code, to high professional open-source standards, impactful algorithmic and modeling outputs from the PLAI group. Also, importantly, to respond to team and program requests for software outputs and solutions to challenge problems imposed by DARPA, etc.

This position is different to most industry machine learning developer positions in that the job holder will be implementing state of the art algorithms and working directly with and in support of the researchers developing these algorithms. For this reason, the job can be reasonably expected to be extremely challenging in terms of how fast the job holder will have to be able to take up and understand new techniques and technology. The positive consequence of this is that the job will not be boring.



Organizational Status


Reports to the faculty member responsible for the research grant and software development effort. Incumbent will also interact with other faculty, postdoctoral research fellows and students in the laboratory.



Work Performed


Design, develop, and implement custom machine learning systems based on current research
Translate laboratory research into open-source software
Respond, in code and produced outputs, to DARPA-specified challenge problems
Collaborate with research team, sponsor, and external team members
Participate in coordination calls with DARPA and external team members
Manage technical relationships with some DARPA and external team members
Document and maintain open-source software repositories



Supervision Received


Formally reports to Dr. Wood; daily supervision will be provided by the laboratory manager, postdoctoral researchers, and senior research PhD students in the group.



Supervision Given


On a case by case basis, student programmers (interns and the like) may be hired to assist the overall effort and direct management of their software practice and output may be expected. As well, junior PhD and MS students' software outputs may be managed throughout.



Consequence of Error/Judgement


Third and fourth year funding on both efforts is contingent on satisfactory performance on DARPA-specified challenge problems. Failure to perform could mean discontinued funding.



Qualifications


Undergraduate degree in Engineering or Applied Science. Machine learning foundation: Required: UBC CS340 (https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/CS340/) or equivalent. Includes: automatic differentiation, regression, classification, SVM's, logistic regression, random forests, conceptual understanding of test/training/validation and understanding of overfitting on the validation set in particular.
Desired: UBC CS540 (https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Courses/540-W18/) or equivalent. Includes: reinforcement learning, Monte-Carlo tree search, stochastic variational inference, graphical models.
Desired: probabilistic programming (https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/CS532W-539W/) A minimum of 5 years of experience or the equivalent combination of education and experience. A reasonable candidate is a professional Python developer with a strong CS or statistics educational background, a high level of familiarity with the Python and PyTorch ecosystems, and an urge to do something more challenging, perhaps en route to a graduate degree or a ML-related startup.
Programming and related CS skills:required: Python, PyTorch, git, compiler and parser programming desired: SLURM, cloud-compute, shell-scripting, databases.

Job Summary


This job is about producing open-source machine learning software in support of DARPA-funded research on ""data driven discovery of models"" (D3M - https://www.darpa.mil/program/data-driven-discovery-of-models) and ""Learning with less labels"" (LWLL - https://www.darpa.mil/program/learning-with-less-labels). The basic idea is to transition research from Dr. Wood's ""programming languages and artificial intelligence"" (PLAI) group at UBC (https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood) into production-quality software that can be shared with other DARPA program performers and the world.

Our collective aim is to leverage techniques from deep learning, reinforcement learning, and probabilistic programming to a) fully automate machine learning (training dataset -> fully trained model) and to do so with orders of magnitude fewer labels (semi- and un-supervised learning).
The basic job will be to code, to high professional open-source standards, impactful algorithmic and modeling outputs from the PLAI group. Also, importantly, to respond to team and program requests for software outputs and solutions to challenge problems imposed by DARPA, etc.

This position is different to most industry machine learning developer positions in that the job holder will be implementing state of the art algorithms and working directly with and in support of the researchers developing these algorithms. For this reason, the job can be reasonably expected to be extremely challenging in terms of how fast the job holder will have to be able to take up and understand new techniques and technology. The positive consequence of this is that the job will not be boring.



Organizational Status


Reports to the faculty member responsible for the research grant and software development effort. Incumbent will also interact with other faculty, postdoctoral research fellows and students in the laboratory.



Work Performed


Design, develop, and implement custom machine learning systems based on current research
Translate laboratory research into open-source software
Respond, in code and produced outputs, to DARPA-specified challenge problems
Collaborate with research team, sponsor, and external team members
Participate in coordination calls with DARPA and external team members
Manage technical relationships with some DARPA and external team members
Document and maintain open-source software repositories



Supervision Received


Formally reports to Dr. Wood; daily supervision will be provided by the laboratory manager, postdoctoral researchers, and senior research PhD students in the group.



Supervision Given


On a case by case basis, student programmers (interns and the like) may be hired to assist the overall effort and direct management of their software practice and output may be expected. As well, junior PhD and MS students' software outputs may be managed throughout.



Consequence of Error/Judgement


Third and fourth year funding on both efforts is contingent on satisfactory performance on DARPA-specified challenge problems. Failure to perform could mean discontinued funding.



Qualifications


Undergraduate degree in Engineering or Applied Science. Machine learning foundation: Required: UBC CS340 (https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/CS340/) or equivalent. Includes: automatic differentiation, regression, classification, SVM's, logistic regression, random forests, conceptual understanding of test/training/validation and understanding of overfitting on the validation set in particular.

About Newtrax
Newtrax has joined Sandvik Mining and Rock Technology as a Standalone Business Unit. Newtrax believes the future of mining is underground, not only because minerals close to the surface are increasingly rare, but because underground mines have a significantly lower environmental footprint.
To accelerate the transition to a future where 100% of mining is underground, Newtrax eliminates the current digital divide between surface mines and underground mines. To achieve this goal, Newtrax integrates the latest Internet-of-Things and Artificial Intelligence technologies to monitor and provide insights on underground operations, including people, machines and the environment.

To accelerate the transition to a future where 100% of mining is underground, Newtrax eliminates the current digital divide between surface mines and underground mines. To achieve this goal, Newtrax integrates the latest Internet-of-Things and Artificial Intelligence technologies to monitor and provide insights on underground operations, including people, machines and the environment.

About Joining Our Embedded Software Engineering Talent Community
We are constantly looking for phenomenal people to join our team � but we also understand that timing is everything.
You may not be ready to make a move, but you�re open to exploring your options. We�re planning on growing steadily over the next several years � so whether you�re looking now or later � we�ll probably have something interesting for you to consider at some point soon.
Joining our talent community for Embedded Software development means we�ll stay in touch, keep you informed on what we�re doing, what�s happening in our industry, and connect from time to time with some new positions we believe you�ll want to hear about.
Software at a Glance
We don�t make apps, we have no web development teams, and our idea of user-experience is a lot different than most other organizations.
For us, user experience could mean a Search and Rescue pilot finding an injured hiker in the mountains at night using our infrared optical systems. It could mean a military pilot performing classified surveillance on a hostile target from 25 kms away, while being able to read a license plate as if it were a meter away�
Our software teams work directly with our optics and hardware teams � developing code that manages all of our systems controllers and actuators, or telephoto lenses. We develop advanced real time software for various applications and processors, including new payloads like complex imagers, laser illuminators & targeting designators, range finders and trackers.
We develop the embedded controls and user interfaces for complex electro-mechanical systems including remote I/O subsystems, custom lens controllers, and advanced video processing features.
Domain Expertise We Look For
This depends on a lot of factors � but we�ll start with our tech-stack. It�s simple but effective.
Embedded C with C++ and Python on an Embedded Linux OS. We�ll get into more of the technology below, but we look for a variety of subject-matter expertise for our team - from understanding electrical engineering concepts and principles, and control system theory, to board bring up and practical experience with real time operating systems and multithreaded real time code.
We look for software engineers who know thread-safe low level driver development and hardware abstraction layer development. Communication protocols are a pretty big deal around here � whether it�s RS232, I2C, SPI � even Ethernet.
We�re always looking for people who can understand the design and operation of complex interrelated subsystems and complex electro optical assemblies, code refactoring, signal processing, and those who can just simply figure out how to make something work that is theoretically impossible like solving an in-field or in-service problem�
Your area of expertise is something we may need immediately, or later on down the road � but at some point in time, we�d definitely like a chance to get to know you a little better.
Skills, Experience and Competencies We Look For
While this list is in no particular order - you should be able to identify many of the following within your own inventory of �Things You�re Really Good At�
Embedded C, C++, Embedded Linux
Python
ARM Cortex (M3/4, A8/9), PowerPC, dsPIC, Stellaris
RS232/422, i2Cm SPI, CAN
vxWorks, RTEMS or ThreadX
Some understanding of the ISO 12207 software development standard.
Knowledge of embedded communications standards such as I2C, SPI, CAN, Serial, Ethernet.
If you have some experience with avionics communication standards such as 1553, Arinc-429 � that would be great
Analysis and problem solving at a higher level
Also, the ability to play a musical instrument is also high on the list � we have 7 in-company bands and we�re always looking for a guitar lead or a drummer.
Life at L3 WESCAM
This is the most important part. Many companies say that their work is �exciting� or �challenging�, or that they work in a �fast-paced environment�. Perhaps our definition of those terms is slightly different � because we are one of the only companies in the world that produce what we do, have customers like we do, allow our employees to work on the kinds of things we do, and say with certainty that what we do every day directly contributes to protecting lives around the world.
What else can you expect as an L3 WESCAM employee?
Every other Friday off
Free on-site gym
Subsidized gourmet cafeterias
Free fruit and bagels
Beach Volleyball courts
26 acres of forested land with hiking and biking trails in the heart of Burlington
Free wellness programs
Work/Life balance that is taken seriously
Real opportunities for growth, development and career progression
Everyone�s role at L3 WESCAM contributes to protecting people�s lives

By residing in our Software Engineering Talent Community, we�ll keep you up to date on what L3 WESCAM is working on from a software perspective, new developments in our business, and more information about the team and what it means to work here.
You�ll also be the first to hear about new positions coming up that we hope you might be interested in.
**As L3-WESCAM is a supplier to several national military and defense agencies, we are bound by the Canadian Controlled Goods Program. Every L3 employee must be CGP-Certified, of which certification requires extensive background screening that L3 Wescam will manage on your behalf.

Intelligent machines powered by AI computers that can learn, reason and interact with people are no longer science fiction. Today, a self-driving car powered by Artificial Intelligence can meander through a country road at night and find its way. An AI-powered robot can learn motor skills through trial and error. This is truly an outstanding time.
Image recognition and speech recognition — GPU deep learning has provided the foundation for machines to learn, perceive, reason and solve problems. The GPU started out as the engine for simulating human imagination, conjuring up the amazing virtual worlds of video games and Hollywood films. Now, Nvidia’s GPU runs deep learning algorithms, simulating human intelligence, and acts as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. Just as human imagination and intelligence are linked, computer graphics and artificial intelligence come together in our architecture. Two modes of the human brain, two modes of the GPU. This may explain why Nvidia GPUs are used broadly for deep learning, and Nvidia is increasingly known as “the AI computing company.”

SAMETRICA is a SaaS company that helps clients prove and improve the impact of their social investments by using hard metrics. Our product creates models, collects data and reports on whether social investments are generating value through higher productivity, efficient use of social services, and creating a measurable difference in people’s lives.
We’re a diverse team that thrives on challenging each other to reach the next milestone, the next project, the next innovation. If you have a passion for innovation, this challenge is for you.
Who you are
You are inquisitive by nature, and spend your leisure time following topics in sociology, economics, technology (particularly artificial intelligence) and/or political science. When you’re debating with colleagues and friends, you have a reputation for pulling out The Economist, other news sources (i.e. podcasts), or relevant facts to support your argument. You’ve considered going into public policy, but large bureaucracies sound stifling. You are looking for a dynamic, data-driven, and impactful role where you can learn the ropes and advance quickly, preferably in the area of social innovation.
You are fluent in translating between qualitative and quantitative language, ideas, and data. That means you are not afraid of large datasets, and are able to cut through the noise using statistical analysis to tell a credible, evidence-based story of what is happening in a particular context.

Configure the SAMETRICA platform for our clients using specifications provided by senior ProService team members. This includes liaising with customers on survey design and other data collection methods.
Work with our engineering team to train and enhance SAMETRICA’s proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms.
Writing narrative documents including pulling secondary academic sources quickly from JSTOR and other libraries. This includes strict adherence to proper citation and referencing in the MLA or CMS style.
Completing Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, including ensuring fonts, colours, and other design elements are consistent, clear, and to specifications.
After grasping the basics of our work, you will also begin:
Assisting with client strategy and visioning, and coming up with a “theory of change”, or a narrative for the social, economic, and environmental change our clients are trying to create.
Working with SAMETRICA’s artificial intelligence engineers to find new ways to measure and model complex social issues.
Working with our database analyst and design director to create business intelligence dashboards for our customers in SAMETRICA.
